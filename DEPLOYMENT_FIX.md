# Deployment Fix Summary

## Issue Resolved

The main error in the deployment was a routing conflict:

```
Error: The provided export path '/' doesn't match the '/[...slug]' page.
```

This happened because we had both:
1. A root page at `app/page.tsx`
2. A catch-all route at `app/[...slug]/page.tsx` that was trying to handle the root path

## Changes Made

1. **Moved the catch-all route**: Renamed `app/[...slug]` to `app/_old_slug` to avoid the conflict.

2. **Created a non-optional parameter route**: Added `app/[slug]/page.tsx` with specific static paths.

3. **Fixed the root page**: Updated `app/page.tsx` to properly render the App component directly.

4. **Updated `vercel.json`**: Added rewrites to ensure proper routing.

5. **Created a deployment script**: Added `deploy.sh` to automate the deployment process.

## Deployment Instructions

1. Make sure all environment variables are set in Vercel:
   - `MONGODB_URI` - Your MongoDB connection string
   - `ADMIN_USERNAME` - Username for admin area 
   - `ADMIN_PASSWORD` - Password for admin area

2. Run the deployment script:
   ```bash
   ./deploy.sh
   ```

3. Verify that the site works correctly after deployment, especially:
   - The home page (/)
   - Dynamic routes like /insurance, /plans, etc.
   - Admin area at /admin/stats
   - Click tracking functionality

## Additional Notes

- The previous catch-all route was trying to handle too many paths including the root path
- Using non-optional parameter routes gives more control over which paths are valid
- The root page should render the same content as the catch-all route was attempting to do
